# Snake Water Gun Game (Python)

A simple Snake Water Gun game built using Python.

This is my first Python project and is currently a **work in progress**.

##  Game Modes

### 1. Play with Computer
- Player plays against the computer
- Computer move is randomly generated
- Game result is displayed after each round
- Replay option (`Type 0 to play again`) will be improved using loops

### 2. Play with Friend (Local Two-Player Mode)
- Two players play from the same device
- Both players enter their moves manually
- Logic is partially written and will be completed soon

##  Tech Stack
- Python
- Random module

##  Project Status
- Single Player Mode: Partially complete
- Friend Mode:  Under development
- Replay loop:  Planned improvement

This project is being improved step by step as I learn Python concepts.
